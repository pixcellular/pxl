# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to pixcellular/pxl! 
This document provides a brief set of guidelines for contributing.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/pixcellular/pxl/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that describes the way we coÃ¶perate within the project.
Also, please note these guide lines are work in progress, and suggestions to improve them are appreciated.

## Pull Request Process

We currently use a "fork and pull" model for collaborative software development.
From the GitHub Help Page of [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/):
> The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

Please follow the these steps when creating a Pull Request:

1. Please first discuss the change you wish to make via a [github issue](https://github.com/pixcellular/pxl/issues) before making a change. 
2. Ensure the code builds and all tests succeed when creating a pull request.
3. When making changes to the API, please update the jsdocs and/or documentation.
4. After you have resolved any problems, the owner of the repository will merge the pull request.
